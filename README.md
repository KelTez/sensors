## About
This repository contains code for all the sensors on the Waterloop current pod. As new sensors
are added, more code will be added to this repo. Anyone working on sensors and scripts related
to sensor data, work in this repository.

## IMU Sensor
This library contains code to control Adafruit IMUs to reliably determine pod position. For further
documentation read [`IMU`]("https://github.com/teamwaterloop/sensors/tree/master/src/imu/IMU_README.md") readme file.
